# 3w6 - split ortholinear keyboard

The 3w6 is a low profile, split ortholinear keyboard with 36 keys.

I needed a keyboard for work and wasn't really satisfied with the available alternatives (namely Corne, Kyria and Ferris), mostly because they were rather large and didn't had the spacing I would like.

It's designed to be a no frills, cheap and small keyboard to be taken everywhere.

So no hotswap, no multiple switchtypes, no encoders, no LEDs.

BUT with onboard controllers (so no extra ProMicros, Elite-C), production files including SMT assembly files, and sturdy through hole mounted USB-C connectors.

## try it
You can print [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weteor/3W6/main/plate_outline.pdf) to test if you like the layout. Or mount it to some cardboard and test it with your favourite switches.
